# LoreX-Game-Library
A game library targeted for beginner Java game developers who want to create 2D CPU-Intensive and High FPS games.

DISCLAIMER: This game library is open for any people to use. It is strictly designed to create 2D games in Java. These games are high FPS
  and CPU-Intensive. LoreX does not support ANY 3-Dimensional platforms. All of its methods (functions) aid only in 2D java development. 
  You may request as many pull requests as you would like, as long as they offer strict benefit to the library and its userbase.

SOUND LIBRARY:
I use Paulscode's Sound Library. In order to use it, you must use the JAR version. Don't use Maven.

FEATURES:
  LoreX features many options for 2D Java development. It has mathematical functions that aid in coordinate-intensive frameworks, as well
  as a class that takes PNG images from file and turns them into a BufferedImage object.
  
  - Mathematical Coordinate System Helpers
    • Method to test if a certain coordinate is in a range of two boundaries
    • Method to test if a certain coordinate is within four boundaries (quadrilateral object)
    •• Coming Soon ••
      • Method to test if a certain coordinate is within 6 - 10 points. (Can cause memory issues, use the primary functions instead for
        fast work.
  - Image Loader
    • Method to convert PNG files to a BufferedImage object (returns BufferedImage)
    •• Coming Soon ••
      • Method to convert JPEG files to a BufferedImage object (returns BufferedImage) (May already be implemented)
      • Method to convert GIF files to a BufferedImage object (returns BufferedImage) (May already be implemented)
      • Method to convert ICON files to a BufferedImage object (returns BufferedImage) (Probably not implemented, might need alternate
      code.)
